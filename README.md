# sia10f_robot
This repository contains the simulation files for the Motoman SIA10F robot, created to help fellow developers who struggled to find the sia10f_description package online. The simulation is based on resources from the Construct team, the Motoman SIA10F sim created by FH Aachen, and Alberto Ezquerro Baraibar. All credit goes to the original authors.
